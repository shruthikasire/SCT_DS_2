Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, trends, and gain insights into factors that influenced passenger survival.

🎯 Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Handle missing and inconsistent values
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Analyze relationships between different features
Identify key patterns and trends affecting survival

📂 Dataset
Name: Titanic Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Description:
The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:
Passenger class (Pclass)
Sex
Age
Fare
Embarked location
Survival status (Survived)

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Handled missing values in columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked
Converted categorical variables into appropriate formats
Removed or treated outliers where necessary
Verified data consistency and data types

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
Survival rate comparison by gender
Survival distribution across passenger classes
Age and fare distribution analysis
Correlation analysis between numerical features
Visualization of survival trends using plots and charts

📈 Visualization Techniques Used
Bar plots
Histograms
Box plots
Heatmaps
Count plots

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
